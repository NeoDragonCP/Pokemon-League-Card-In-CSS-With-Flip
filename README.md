# Pokemon-League-Card-In-CSS-With-Flip
Based on the League Cards from Pokemon Sword and Shield, here is a Hop inspired card with a hover to flip the card effect.

I thought this would just be a fun little project.
All of the styling was done in CSS/SASS.
The image of Hop (the character) and the screenshot behind him were found on Google, the links are in the style sheet.
It would be neat if one of the pokemon sites used this with the official artwork.
