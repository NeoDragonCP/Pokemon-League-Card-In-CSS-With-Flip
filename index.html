          This Pok√©mon Trainer got endorsed to take part in the Gym Challenge
          by his
          brother- the reigning Champion, Leon. Hop claims to have watched all
          Leon's
          matches. Commentators speculate that as a result, he might be quite
          the force to
          be reckoned with. The Champion himself has said that his brother has
          potential,
          but his carefully hoarded knowledge can go to waste as he tends to
          get easily
          flustered in battle. It's said that Hop's partner Wooloo is a great
          help to him
          both in battle and with chores around the house.
